You have to always read and update the TODO.md file in the root of this project.

Be specific on the task and give a brief context around it. Remember the next person that get this note will have to pinponit the exact problem and continue from where you left.

Never take all at once, first ask what the users wants to prioritize.

Neveer give as done a taks before confirming with the user.


📋 TODO.md Structure
Sections:

✅ Done - Completed (with completion date + test)
🔄 In Progress - Currently being worked on
📋 To Do - Planned
💡 Ideas - Future ideas

📝 Required Format for Each Item
- [ ] **Task title** | Created: YYYY-MM-DD | Modified: YYYY-MM-DD
  - Description of what needs to be done
  - Comments: [notes on progress, blockers, etc.]
  - Status: [pending/in progress/resolved/tested]

🥇 Golden Rules
Always record modification dates in the Modified field
Include comments about progress, blockers, decisions
Mark resolved AND tested separately (you sometimes mark as resolved without testing)
NEVER delete anything from the backlog — items move between sections, they don't disappear
