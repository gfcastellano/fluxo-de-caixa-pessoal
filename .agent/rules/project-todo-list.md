You have to always read and update the TODO.md file in the root of this project.

Be specific on the task and give a brief context around it. Remember the next person that get this note will ahve to pinponit the exact problem and continue from where you left.

Never take all at once, first ask what the users wants to prioritize

Bullets points

Never delete tasks, either check them as canceled (why) or completed (how, tips if any).

Always update them after something changed. A better view of the challenges, a better description. So that you and others can view the progress of the changes
